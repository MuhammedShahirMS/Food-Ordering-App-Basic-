1.	Food Order App (My First Project using React.js)

• A Simple Web app showing a Menu of 4 dishes from which we can order.
• A Cart that pops up with a button Click and we can increase/decrease the desired quantity for each Item.
• Total Amount is shown in the Summary section of the Cart.
• If we decrease any item's quantity to zero, it gets removed from the Cart immediately.
• Hitting the Order button brings a Form for Address input we must fill.
• If we cancel the Order before hitting the Place Order button, the Cart gets cleared cancelling the Order.
• Successful Orders get stored in a backend (Firebase).

Project done with: React JS | Create React App | React Context API | Firebase Realtime Database | CSS Modules

More info:
- The Menu is actually fetched from a backend (Firebase RealTime Database) and in case of No Internet connection, an error message will be displayed.
- I used React Context for this Project for managing a Central Provider for different files.
- My Next Project (E-commerce-app) is much bigger than this as it uses Routing, Authentication and many other features. Please have a look.
